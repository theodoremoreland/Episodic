# Episodic
Episodic was created for the sole purpose of demonstrating experience with certain technologies and patterns. It began as an abridged version of the "Weekly Absence Tracker", but distinguishes itself enough to have become a spiritual successor in some regards. In any event, the themes used in Episodic were excercised as a way to make it unique, but serves no practical purpose.

Episodic lets users share reviews for episodic Anime releases. The idea being that it could be adapted into a platform where users can share their excitement and passion for a current series while exploring the merits of a given show with broadened perspective. Users can also share facts about themselves which can later be used to explore potential correlations between reviews and reviewer.

Episodic currently has four views / web pages: "Trends", "Review Form", "Review History", and "Reviewer Metadata". Screenshots and descriptions for each view can be found in the Screenshots section below.
